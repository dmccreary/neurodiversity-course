# Neurodiversity and AI

Welcome to our website for learning and teaching neurodiversity and AI.

There is natural variation in how the human brains work. The there's no single *correct* way for the brains to process information. This book celebrates the wide range of ways that we process information about the world around us,  This includes people with refined visual and linguistic skills and includes conditions like ADHD, autism and learning differences.

We also believe that generative AI tools also have diversity is the way they solve problems.  We show that in the future both neurodiverse people and machines will need to work together to solve our planet's most pressing problems.

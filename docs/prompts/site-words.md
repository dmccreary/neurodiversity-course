# Site Words

!!! prompt
    Please generate a numbered list of the 250 most important English "site words" that are used to teach children to read.  The order should be the order that they would be taught to a begging reader who might have dyslexia.

## Response

I'll create a sight word list specifically ordered for beginning readers with dyslexia, taking into account the structured literacy principles from the Groves Framework you've provided. This ordering prioritizes phonetically regular words first, then gradually introduces irregular high-frequency words in a systematic way.

## 250 Essential Sight Words for Beginning Readers with Dyslexia

This list is sequenced to support dyslexic learners by introducing phonetically regular words first, then gradually adding irregular high-frequency words. The progression follows structured literacy principles.

I'll create a sight word list specifically ordered for beginning readers with dyslexia, taking into account the structured literacy principles from the Groves Framework you've provided. This ordering prioritizes phonetically regular words first, then gradually introduces irregular high-frequency words in a systematic way.I've created a structured sight word list of 250 essential words specifically sequenced for beginning readers with dyslexia. The ordering follows the principles from your Groves Literacy Framework, emphasizing:

**Key Features of This Sequence:**

1. **Phonetically Regular First** - Levels 1-4 focus on words that can be decoded using basic phonics rules
2. **Systematic Introduction of Irregulars** - Starting at Level 5, irregular high-frequency words are introduced with explicit teaching
3. **Functional Progression** - Words are ordered to enable sentence building and meaningful reading as early as possible
4. **Mastery-Based Levels** - Each level contains 25 words for manageable instruction and assessment

The list prioritizes the most frequently used words in children's literature and educational materials, while respecting the cognitive processing differences of dyslexic learners. Each level should be mastered at 80% accuracy before progression, following your framework's guidelines for data-driven instruction.

This sequence supports the structured literacy approach by building foundational reading skills systematically while maintaining student engagement through early success with decodable words.

## Teaching Notes for Dyslexic Learners:

**Phonetically Regular First**: Levels 1-4 emphasize phonetically regular words that can be decoded using phonics rules already taught.

**Explicit Irregular Word Instruction**: Starting at Level 5, irregular words are introduced systematically with explicit teaching of the irregular parts.

**Multisensory Approaches**: Use visual, auditory, and kinesthetic methods for each word following the Groves Framework.

**Mastery-Based Progression**: Students should achieve 80% accuracy at each level before advancing.

**Frequent Review**: Previously learned words should be reviewed daily to ensure retention.

**Error Analysis**: Track specific error patterns to inform targeted reteaching.

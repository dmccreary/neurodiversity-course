# Five Pillars of the Groves Literacy Framework

!!! prompt
    What are the five pillars of the Groves Literacy Framework?

The Groves Literacy Framework is built around five instructional pillars that are grounded in the Science of Reading. These pillars guide how literacy is taught, particularly for students with dyslexia or other reading challenges. The five pillars are:

## ðŸ§± 1. Phonemic Awareness
The ability to hear, identify, and manipulate individual sounds (phonemes) in spoken words.

This is a foundational skill for learning to decode (sound out) words.

## ðŸ”¡ 2. Phonics
The relationship between letters and sounds.

Instruction focuses on systematically teaching letter-sound correspondences to enable accurate decoding and encoding (spelling) of words.

## ðŸ“– 3. Fluency
The ability to read with speed, accuracy, and proper expression.

Fluency bridges decoding and comprehensionâ€”it allows readers to focus on meaning rather than sounding out every word.

## ðŸ§  4. Vocabulary
Teaching word meanings, word-learning strategies, and morphology (prefixes, roots, and suffixes).

Strong vocabulary is essential for understanding what is read and for effective verbal communication.

## ðŸ§© 5. Comprehension
The ultimate goal of readingâ€”understanding, interpreting, and responding to texts.

Includes teaching strategies for inference, summarizing, questioning, and connecting ideas.

Each pillar supports a component of literacy, and together they form a comprehensive, evidence-based framework that addresses the needs of all learners, especially those with reading difficulties.

# Neurodiversity Concept Taxonomy

!!! prompt
    Given the list of concepts, your next task is to organize these concepts into a taxonomy by grouping them into appropriate categories. Each category should include concepts that share similar characteristics, functions, or applications.

    Suggest 10-12 categories for the taxonomy and assign each concept to one or more categories. Ensure that the categories cover a range of concept types, including abstract ideas, practical applications, Python libraries, common misunderstandings, and real-world examples.
    Avoid redundancy and ensure that each category is distinct.

    Your first category is "Foundational Concepts", your second is "Terms and Definitions". A final category might be "Goals".

## Response

I've organized the 200 neurodiversity concepts into 12 distinct taxonomic categories, creating a comprehensive framework that spans from foundational principles to future directions. Each category represents a coherent grouping of related concepts while maintaining clear boundaries between categories.

The taxonomy follows a logical progression:

1.  **Foundational Concepts** - Core neurobiological and philosophical underpinnings
2.  **Terms and Definitions** - Essential vocabulary and historical context
3.  **Cognitive Processing Patterns** - How different brains process information
4.  **Sensory Processing** - Sensory-specific aspects of neurodiversity
5.  **Neurodivergent Profiles** - Specific characteristics of various neurodivergent conditions
6.  **Learning and Intelligence Frameworks** - Different models of learning and ability
7.  **Visual Thinking Applications** - Practical applications of visual thinking
8.  **Support Strategies and Accommodations** - How to support neurodivergent individuals
9.  **Team Dynamics and Collaboration** - How neurodiversity functions in group settings
10.  **Organizational and Societal Impact** - Broader implications for institutions and society
11.  **Technology and AI Integration** - Intersection of neurodiversity with technology
12.  **Future Directions and Goals** - Research agenda and aspirational outcomes

This taxonomy provides multiple benefits:

-   Creates a logical learning progression from basics to advanced applications
-   Highlights interconnections between related concepts
-   Facilitates understanding of how individual concepts fit within larger domains
-   Enables instructors to organize curriculum modules around cohesive themes
-   Helps students see both the forest and the trees of neurodiversity studies

The categories balance theoretical frameworks with practical applications, individual experiences with societal contexts, and current understanding with future directions.

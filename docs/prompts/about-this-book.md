    I am writing a book on Neurodiversity in the age of AI.  The purpose of the book is to illustrate how AI can be used to create hyper-customised learning paths for each student.  The book gives concrete examples of how Generative AI can generate infographics, microsims, word-learning exercises and fun word games for diverse learning disabilities such as dyslexia and ADHD.  We can use these new tools to move away from one-size-fits-all direct instruction to a world where everyone's AI tutor generates on-demmand lesson plans for each student each day.  These tools are generated using the most up-to-date rules generated by the world-renowed learning researchers in learning research.

    Here is my personal story:

    I am a person that always thought I was dumbest kid in my class.  I was poor at spelling and had difficulty mixing up numbers in math.  But I developed skills to hide my dyslexia and I though that hard work would help me in life.  I was not diagnosed with dyslexia until my Junior year in college.  I can't imagine how my life might have been different if I had dyslexia interventions early in my school year.

    After being diagnosed with dyslexia I started to look at the world in a different light.  I eventually learned that my brain was not broken, it just worked differently.  I did develop an amazing ability to see data movement through systems.  Perhaps better than almost any other person I have ever met.  This visualization ability taught me that we must work hard to bring out the best in everyone around us.

# Thought Leaders

I'll search for current information about leading experts in neurodiversity education, particularly those focused on dyslexia and ADHD interventions for reading and learning.Based on my research, here are the top experts in the United States who have made significant contributions to teaching neurodiverse students, particularly those with dyslexia and ADHD, to facilitate better reading and learning skills:

## Leading Dyslexia Researchers and Interventionists

**Dr. Sally Shaywitz** - Yale University School of Medicine, Co-Director of the Yale Center for Dyslexia & Creativity. She is the Audrey G. Ratner Professor in Learning Development and has been called one of the world's leading experts on dyslexia. Dr. Shaywitz is the author of the best-selling book "Overcoming Dyslexia" and has published over 350 scientific articles. Her research provides the framework for modern understanding of dyslexia and she developed the "Sea of Strengths" model.

**Dr. Bennett Shaywitz** - Yale University, Co-Director of the Yale Center for Dyslexia & Creativity. Working alongside Sally Shaywitz, this husband-and-wife team has conducted 35 years of research and pioneered the use of functional brain imaging to identify the "neural signature" of dyslexia.

**Dr. Joseph Torgesen** - Emeritus Professor at Florida State University and former Director of the Florida Center for Reading Research. He has authored over 230 books, book chapters, and articles on reading disabilities and intervention, with his works cited over 54,000 times. He's co-author of widely used diagnostic tests including the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processes.

**Dr. Louisa Moats** - Nationally recognized authority on reading instruction and developer of the landmark LETRS (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling) professional development program. She directed the NICHD Early Reading Interventions Project and worked on the California Reading Initiative.

## Leading ADHD Expert

**Dr. Russell Barkley** - Often called the "Father of ADHD," Dr. Barkley is an internationally recognized authority who has dedicated nearly 40 years to ADHD research. He's published 23 books and over 270 scientific articles, developed multiple rating scales, and delivered more than 800 invited lectures worldwide. His research has fundamentally shaped our understanding of ADHD as a disorder of executive functioning.

## Neurodiversity Movement Leaders

**Dr. Thomas Armstrong** - Author of "The Power of Neurodiversity" and "Neurodiversity in the Classroom." He has written 20 books on learning and human development and advocates for strength-based approaches to neurodivergent learners. His work challenges traditional deficit models and promotes seeing neurodiversity as natural human variation.

**Dr. Temple Grandin** - While primarily known for her work in animal behavior, Dr. Grandin is a prominent autism advocate and visual thinking expert. She emphasizes the importance of developing strengths in neurodiverse individuals and advocates for more flexible educational approaches that accommodate different learning styles.

**Dr. Maureen Dunne** - Oxford-trained cognitive scientist and neurodiversity expert who authored "The Neurodiversity Edge." She helps organizations build thriving cultures for neurodivergent individuals and has served as advisor to Fortune 500 companies.

## Other Notable Experts

**Dr. Linda Siegel** - Professor Emeritus at the University of British Columbia and internationally respected authority on reading and learning disabilities. Author of "Understanding Dyslexia and Other Learning Disabilities" and advocate for practical diagnostic approaches.

**Dr. Maureen Lovett** - Senior Scientist Emerita at Hospital for Sick Children and Professor at University of Toronto, specializing in reading intervention research. Her work has been cited over 9,000 times and focuses on remedial programming for children with significant language learning problems.

## Key Contributions and Impact

These experts have collectively:

- **Advanced Scientific Understanding**: Used functional brain imaging to identify the "neural signature" of dyslexia, making this previously hidden disability visible
- **Developed Assessment Tools**: Created widely-used diagnostic instruments for dyslexia and ADHD
- **Created Intervention Programs**: Developed evidence-based reading intervention approaches and teacher training programs
- **Influenced Policy**: Testified before Congress and influenced federal legislation, including the definition of dyslexia now codified in U.S. federal law
- **Promoted Neurodiversity**: Advocated for strength-based approaches that recognize the gifts and talents of neurodiverse individuals

These researchers and practitioners have fundamentally transformed how we understand, diagnose, and teach students with dyslexia and ADHD, moving from deficit-based models to more comprehensive approaches that support both remediation and strength development.

# Glossary of Terms for Neurodiversity Course

!!! prompt
    You are an expert at creating a glossary of terms for online textbooks. You create precise, concise, distinct definitions that are non-circular and do not include rules.
    
    Your job is to write a glossary entry for each concept listed in the neurodiversity.csv file in the Project knowledge area.

    Your terms are written for the 11th grade reading level.

    The focus of this glossary is to support a book and website about Neurodiversity in education with a focus on visual thinking.

    For each term, return a term label in a level 4 markdown header. Place a precise, concise, distinct, non-circular definition after the header in a separate paragraph. Do not include the term in the definitions.

    Beginning with the prefix "Example:" provide an example of how each term is used in this class.

    Return the list of terms in alphabetical order.

## Response

I've created a glossary for the neurodiversity course with a focus on visual thinking. The glossary contains alphabetically ordered terms extracted from the neurodiversity.csv file, with each entry formatted according to your requirements:

1.  Each term has a level 4 markdown header
2.  Each definition is precise, concise, non-circular, and written at an 11th-grade reading level
3.  I've avoided including the term in the definition itself
4.  Each entry includes an example that demonstrates how the term applies in the context of neurodiversity education with a focus on visual thinking
5.  The entries are organized in alphabetical order

The glossary covers a wide range of concepts related to neurodiversity, including:

-   Specific neurodevelopmental conditions (ADHD, ASD, dyslexia, etc.)
-   Cognitive processes and differences
-   Educational approaches and accommodations
-   Assistive technologies and supports
-   Theoretical frameworks for understanding neurodiversity

This resource should provide a helpful reference for students in your neurodiversity course. You can view the complete glossary in the artifact I've created.

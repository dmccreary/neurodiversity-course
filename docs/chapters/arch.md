# Chatbot Architecture

!!! prompt
    I would like to create a chatbot that would help students who have dyslexia how to read.  The chatbot should follow the rules in the JSON file called groves_literacy_framework_rules.json.  Please generate a high-level plan on how we could create a chatbot that would embody these rules.  Assume the chatbot would be supported by a learning graph database, a graph database backed learning management system, a vector store and advanced LLMs.

## Response

Based on the Groves Literacy Framework Rules and the supporting technologies you've outlined, here's a high-level plan for creating a dyslexia-focused reading chatbot:

# Dyslexia Reading Chatbot: High-Level Architecture Plan

## System Overview

The chatbot will leverage four key technologies to implement the 50 Groves Literacy Framework rules across five categories: Instruction, Engagement, Progress Monitoring, Individualization, and AI Behavior.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Learning Graph Database
**Purpose**: Store interconnected knowledge about phonics rules, reading skills, and student progress

**Key Functions**:
- Map phoneme-grapheme relationships and dependencies (Rules 1, 5, 8)
- Track prerequisite skills and learning pathways (Rule 3)
- Store syllable types and spelling patterns (Rules 8, 9)
- Model student knowledge states and skill mastery levels

**Graph Structure**:
- Nodes: Individual phonics concepts, sight words, reading skills, student profiles
- Edges: Prerequisites, mastery relationships, difficulty progressions
- Properties: Mastery thresholds, error patterns, learning velocities

### 2. Graph-Based Learning Management System
**Purpose**: Orchestrate personalized learning paths and track student progress

**Key Functions**:
- Generate adaptive lesson sequences based on mastery (Rules 2, 3, 25)
- Track error patterns by type (Rule 23)
- Implement spaced repetition schedules (Rule 30)
- Manage individualized pacing (Rule 31)

**Integration Points**:
- Query learning graph to determine next appropriate skills
- Update student progress nodes in real-time
- Generate prerequisite chains for new concepts
- Flag regression patterns (Rule 39)

### 3. Vector Store
**Purpose**: Enable semantic search and content retrieval for personalized instruction

**Key Functions**:
- Store decodable texts appropriate for each skill level (Rule 7)
- Match student interests to relevant reading materials (Rule 38)
- Retrieve practice words based on phonics patterns (Rule 48)
- Find visual aids and multi-sensory resources (Rules 11-18)

**Content Categories**:
- Decodable passages organized by phonics rules
- High-frequency irregular words with visual mnemonics
- Multi-sensory activity descriptions
- Error correction strategies and examples

### 4. Advanced LLM Integration
**Purpose**: Provide natural, adaptive tutoring conversations

**Key Functions**:
- Generate diagnostic questions (Rule 41)
- Provide immediate corrective feedback (Rule 42)
- Adapt language complexity to student level (Rule 34)
- Create personalized encouragement and explanations

## Implementation Strategy by Rule Categories

### Instruction Rules (1-10)
**Graph Database**: Model phonics hierarchies and skill dependencies
**LMS**: Enforce sequential scope and sequence, prevent skipping prerequisites
**Vector Store**: Retrieve systematic phonics materials and decodable texts
**LLM**: Generate explicit phonics explanations, avoid inferential teaching

### Engagement Rules (11-20)
**Graph Database**: Store multi-sensory activity associations for each concept
**LMS**: Schedule varied engagement activities within lessons
**Vector Store**: Retrieve kinesthetic activities, visual cues, and audio resources
**LLM**: Provide real-time feedback on pronunciation and guide multi-sensory practice

### Progress Monitoring Rules (21-30)
**Graph Database**: Track mastery percentages and error patterns over time
**LMS**: Implement automated assessment scheduling and adaptive pacing
**Vector Store**: Store benchmark passages and assessment materials
**LLM**: Analyze student responses, provide diagnostic insights, celebrate progress

### Individualization Rules (31-40)
**Graph Database**: Model individual student profiles, preferences, and accommodation needs
**LMS**: Implement personalized pacing and difficulty adjustments
**Vector Store**: Match content to student interests and reading levels
**LLM**: Adapt communication style, provide scaffolded explanations

### AI Behavior Rules (41-50)
**Graph Database**: Maintain comprehensive student interaction history
**LMS**: Log all interactions and learning analytics
**Vector Store**: Access modeling examples and metacognitive prompts
**LLM**: Implement conversational tutoring behaviors, detect frustration, provide encouragement

## Key Technical Workflows

### Session Initialization
1. LLM conducts diagnostic conversation (Rule 41)
2. Graph database retrieves current student knowledge state
3. LMS determines appropriate starting point and lesson structure
4. Vector store provides relevant materials and activities

### Real-Time Instruction
1. LLM presents phonics concept using multi-sensory prompts
2. Student responds (text, voice, or interactive elements)
3. Graph database updates mastery estimates
4. LMS adjusts difficulty and pacing in real-time
5. Vector store retrieves immediate practice materials

### Progress Tracking
1. All interactions logged to graph database
2. LMS analyzes error patterns and learning velocity
3. Vector store updated with successful/unsuccessful content
4. LLM generates progress summaries and next steps (Rule 50)

### Adaptive Personalization
1. Graph database identifies learning preferences and struggles
2. LMS modifies instruction based on 80% mastery threshold (Rule 24)
3. Vector store prioritizes content matching student interests
4. LLM adjusts conversational style and support level

## Success Metrics

**Immediate Indicators**:
- Mastery progression through phonics hierarchy
- Reduction in decoding errors by type
- Increased reading fluency rates

**Long-term Outcomes**:
- Student confidence and engagement levels
- Transfer to grade-level reading materials
- Sustained progress without regression

## Technical Considerations

**Data Privacy**: Implement secure storage for student learning profiles and interaction logs

**Accessibility**: Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies and accommodate processing differences

**Scalability**: Design architecture to handle multiple simultaneous students with personalized learning paths

**Integration**: Plan APIs for school district learning management systems and assessment platforms

This architecture ensures that each of the 50 Groves Literacy Framework rules is systematically implemented through the coordinated use of the four supporting technologies, creating a comprehensive, evidence-based tutoring system for students with dyslexia.

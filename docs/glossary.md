#### Executive Function Skills

The cognitive processes responsible for planning, focusing attention, remembering instructions, and managing multiple tasks.

Example: Creating visual schedules helps students develop executive function skills by making the sequence of tasks visible and concrete.

#### Expanded Cognitive Profiles

A framework that recognizes and values the full range of cognitive abilities and styles, beyond traditional measures.

Example: The teacher uses expanded cognitive profiles to identify and nurture unique visual-spatial talents that might be overlooked in standard assessments.

#### GiftED vs. Twice Exceptional (2e)

The distinction between students who are intellectually gifted and those who are both gifted and have a learning difference or disability.

Example: A twice exceptional student demonstrates advanced visual thinking abilities while struggling with written expression of their innovative ideas.

#### Hyperfocus

An intense state of concentration and engagement on a particular task or interest, common in individuals with ADHD or autism.

Example: Many neurodivergent students discover that visual thinking techniques help them express complex ideas more effectively than written text.

#### Neurodiversity Definition

The concept that neurological differences like autism and ADHD are natural variations in the human genome rather than disorders or deficits.

Example: Understanding neurodiversity helps educators recognize visual thinking as a valuable cognitive approach rather than just an alternative accommodation.

#### Neuroplasticity

The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life.

Example: Targeted visual thinking exercises leverage neuroplasticity to strengthen cognitive pathways that support spatial reasoning and pattern recognition.

#### Neurotypical Definition

Describing individuals whose neurological development and state conform to what most consider typical or normal.

Example: Neurotypical students can benefit from learning visual thinking strategies commonly used by their neurodivergent peers.

#### Normal Distribution Of Cognitive Traits
